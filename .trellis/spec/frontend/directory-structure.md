# Directory Structure

> How frontend code is organized in this project.

---

## Overview

The repository is a single frontend app with a simple Ionic Vue layout. Code is currently organized by technical role rather than by feature folder.

Current structure:

```text
src/
├── App.vue
├── main.ts
├── vite-env.d.ts
├── components/
│   └── ExploreContainer.vue
├── router/
│   └── index.ts
├── theme/
│   └── variables.css
└── views/
    ├── Tab1Page.vue
    ├── Tab2Page.vue
    ├── Tab3Page.vue
    └── TabsPage.vue
```

Related non-app folders:

```text
tests/
├── e2e/
│   ├── fixtures/
│   ├── specs/
│   └── support/
└── unit/
```

## Module Organization

Use the existing split unless the codebase grows enough to justify feature modules:

- `src/main.ts` owns app bootstrap, plugin registration, global CSS imports, and mount timing.
- `src/App.vue` is the root shell and should stay minimal.
- `src/router/index.ts` owns route records and redirects.
- `src/views/` contains route-level pages.
- `src/components/` contains reusable UI pieces used by pages.
- `src/theme/` contains global Ionic theme customization.

Reference files:

- `src/main.ts`
- `src/App.vue`
- `src/router/index.ts`
- `src/views/TabsPage.vue`

## Routing-Centric Structure

This app currently follows Ionic’s page-container conventions:

- Route-level screens live in `src/views/`.
- The tab shell is implemented as a page component in `src/views/TabsPage.vue`.
- Child tab pages are lazy-loaded from the router using `() => import(...)`.

Reference files:

- `src/router/index.ts`
- `src/views/TabsPage.vue`

Avoid putting route definitions inside page components. Keep navigation structure centralized in `src/router/index.ts`.

---

## Naming Conventions

Current naming patterns in the repo:

- Vue SFC files use PascalCase: `App.vue`, `TabsPage.vue`, `ExploreContainer.vue`.
- Route-level views use a `*Page.vue` suffix: `Tab1Page.vue`, `Tab2Page.vue`, `Tab3Page.vue`.
- Router entry files use conventional names like `index.ts`.
- Use the `@/` alias for imports from `src/`.

Reference files:

- `src/views/Tab1Page.vue`
- `src/components/ExploreContainer.vue`
- `src/router/index.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`

---

## What Does Not Exist Yet

The current codebase does not yet have:

- `composables/` or custom hook directories
- shared `types/` directories
- feature-scoped modules
- service or API client layers
- global store directories such as Pinia or Vuex stores

Do not add these structures preemptively in routine edits. Add them only when the app actually needs them and the task explicitly introduces that architecture.

## Examples

Good reference points for the current shape:

- Root shell: `src/App.vue`
- App bootstrap and CSS loading: `src/main.ts`
- Router-owned page composition: `src/router/index.ts`
- Tab page layout: `src/views/Tab1Page.vue`
- Reusable shared component: `src/components/ExploreContainer.vue`
